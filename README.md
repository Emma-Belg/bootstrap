# bootstrap
Our first bootstrap css 2nd December, this assingment ca be found [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/atw-giertz-2-17/tree/master/1.The-Fields/4.HTML-CSS/3.CSS-Frameworks).

Bootstrap is a CSS framework (basically a heap of other people's code bundled together).
Technically you can use bootstrap without editing any CSS, you simply need to lable your elements correctly so that the right ones are 'activated' from the attached bootstrap (css) that has already been written for us.


### Notes from Carousel

I didn't have java script in my page, that's why my carousel wasn't working. I should look into why it is recommended to put it at the end of your page.

I also added the circle images. That was surprisingly easy, I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of this a little bit, I wrote that whole section from scratch without having any issues about getting things to sit side by side or the displa or anything. But I have a problem that my images are rectangles and are therefore squished a bit when they are in circle form.

I figured out how to "crop" a rectangualr image into a square using css (inline styling in html (I know I'm not meant to use css but how else can I use the same retangular images and have them squre below without squishing them?).
* The inline text is simply: style="object-fit: cover;"
